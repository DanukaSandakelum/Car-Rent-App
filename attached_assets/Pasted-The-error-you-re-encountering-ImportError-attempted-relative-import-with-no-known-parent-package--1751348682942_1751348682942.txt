The error you're encountering, ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package, typically occurs when you are trying to run a module that uses relative imports directly without defining it as part of a package.

To fix this, you can run your Python script as a module instead. You can modify your command to run the app using:

python -m your_package_name.app
Replace your_package_name with the actual name of the package that contains your app.py file.

Alternatively, you can restructure your project so that it is executed in a way that recognizes its package structure. If you simply want to run the script without modifying the package name, you could also use:

python app.py
However, ensure that the working directory is set appropriately so that the imports resolve correctly. If problems persist, consider renaming the import statement in __init__.py to an absolute import:

from views import views
This will depend on your project structure. Make sure the modules can be located based on your directory layout.

Looking at the error, the issue is that you're trying to run app.py directly, but it's using relative imports which require the code to be run as a module within a package structure.

The problem is in your app.py file - it's importing from __init__ using a relative import, but when you run python app.py directly, Python doesn't recognize it as part of a package.

Here's the fix:

app.py
Fix import to use absolute import, Fix import to work when run directly, Fix import to work with direct execution
Actually, let me check the structure again. The issue is that your files are structured as a Flask package but you're trying to run app.py directly. Let me fix this properly:

Wait, I need to see the actual import. Let me fix this correctly by changing the import to work when the file is run directly:

ok

I can see the issue. The problem is that your Flask application is structured as a package (with relative imports using .) but you're running app.py directly. When you run app.py directly, Python doesn't recognize it as part of a package, so the relative imports in __init__.py fail.

The fix is to change the import in app.py to use the module name directly instead of trying to import from __init__:

app.py

Looking at the error and your project structure, the issue is that your Flask app is structured as a package but the relative imports in __init__.py are failing when running app.py directly.

The problem is that all your Python files (__init__.py, views.py, auth.py, models.py) are in the root directory, but they're using relative imports (with .) which expect them to be in a proper package structure.

Let me fix this by changing all the relative imports to absolute imports:

__init__.py
models.py
auth.py
